# php_unicorn_experiment

This is complete experiment that was motivated by https://www.django-unicorn.com/ this module for Django

The main idea is to split your frontend base to components and update each one eventually. So as a frontend developer there is no api in vorwser anymove. 
The whole components updates by the call. 

I suppose this way of rendering makes more security to api and database by the whole-component-render cost

Will proiceed investigation to create a library in JS for any platform
